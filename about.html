        <h1>About Me</h1>
<p id="aboutme">
A little about me is that I am a student at the 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.uri.edu">University of Rhode Island</a> from Hingham Massachusetts.
<br>In my free time I enjoy seeing friends and family, fishing, and exploring new areas.
<br>I also enjoy doing things such as playing tennis sailing, both of which I used to participate in competitively during highschool years and previously.
Additionally i also enjoy occasionally playing basketball recreationally, although my current skillset leaves much to be desired. 
Above all though, however, I enjoy learning and constantly challenging myself with new ideas, 
this allows me to continuously adapt to the world around me and to excel to my fullest potential.
